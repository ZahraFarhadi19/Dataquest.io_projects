# Gender Gap in College Degress

[The Department of Education Statistics](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) releases a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website [here.](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv)

Randal compiled this data set to explore the gender gap in STEM fields, which stands for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. This gap is reported on often in the news and not everyone agrees that there is a gap.

For the purpose of this project, we created some visualizations to show the gender gap in college degrees.


### Prerequisites

1. Anaconda - navigator for using Jupyther notebook. 
2. Python
```
Give examples
```

### Packages Used

1. Pandas
2. Matplotlib

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Process

Since the data was already cleaned, we could start with analysis and visualizations right away. However, we used info() method to make sure all the types were matched. 




### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
