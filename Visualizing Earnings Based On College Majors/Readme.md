## Introduction

In this project, I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. FiveThirtyEight cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

## Variables

Each row in the dataset represented a different major in college and contains information on gender diversity, employment rates, median salaries, and more. Here are some of the columns in the dataset:

## Research Questions:
1. Do students in more popular majors make more money?
2. How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
3. Which category of majors have the most students?
